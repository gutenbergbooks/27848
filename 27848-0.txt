                           SOME PRESS NOTICES


"This work at its best reaches the level of absolute excellence, and the
book is entitled to a warm and grateful welcome."--_Record_.

"Mr Brownlie has taste and a poetic gift, and his verses are easy and
natural, rarely, if ever, betraying the fact that they are the work of a
translator."--_Church Times_.

"This dainty volume will certainly enhance his reputation."--_Glasgow
Herald_.

"It brings into dignified Church-English some sixty simple and powerful
hymns. The book should prove welcome to men generally interested in
hymnody, and particularly to those who are ignorant of the richness of
the Greek liturgy."--_Scotsman_.

"Mr Brownlie has the knack of hymn-writing, and the translations from the
Greek which he has published in this book will be a welcome addition to
English hymnology."--_Athenaeum_.

"Mr Brownlie has done eminent service as a hymnologist and translator of
hymns. These translations are in smooth and flowing English verse, and
the hymns are interesting both on their intrinsic merits and as
representing the religious thought and emotion of an important section of
the Church."--_Aberdeen Free Press_.




                             PREFATORY NOTE


After ten years this, the first of five series of hymns of the Greek
Church, is issued in cheap form in the hope that those who regard the
unity of Christian praise, and wish to realise it, and who seek its
enrichment from the Church of the Apostles, may be induced to give the
subject that consideration which it deserves, and which has been too long
neglected.

The past ten years have seen much activity in the department of Church
hymnody,--all sections of the Church have had their hymnals under
revision with varied results; but in this particular we are bound to feel
satisfaction that the praise literature of the Early and Mediaeval Church
has been more fully drawn upon than at any former period, and the Greek
Church no longer stands in the background. From this volume alone no
fewer than ten renderings have been utilised by hymnal compilers, and
they make together twenty appearances. This fact is mentioned to indicate
an appreciation of Greek hymnody which, it is hoped, may grow.

                              INTRODUCTION


I. Thirty-eight years ago, Dr. John Mason Neale published his _Hymns of
the Eastern Church_ , and for the first time English readers were
introduced to the priceless gems of Greek hymnody. At the close of his
preface he throws out a challenge which, as far as the present writer is
aware, has not yet been taken up. He says: 'And while fully sensible of
their imperfections, I may yet, by way of excuse rather than of boast,
say, almost in Bishop Hall's words--

      "I first adventure: follow me who list,
      And be the second Eastern Melodist."'

It would be presumptuous to believe that the translations which follow
are in any particular a worthy answer to that challenge; but the
translator can honestly say that they are a very earnest attempt to
acquaint English readers still further with the valuable praise
literature which lies buried in the service-books of the Greek Church,
and they constitute the first real attempt in that direction since Dr.
Neale issued his collection in 1862.

II. The renderings contained in this volume are the product of many happy
hours during the past five years. No method was adopted in the work. As
the translator waded through the closely printed pages of the Greek
offices, what appeared at first sight to be lines worthy of translation
were taken up and examined, sometimes to be cast aside again because of
some unremovable blemish, at other times to be moulded to the form which
they now bear. Of the forty-seven pieces, thirty-five appear for the
first time in English verse.

For the original, the translator has gone to the service-books, and for
the most part has confined himself to the hymns which are to be found in
the Triodion, containing the Lenten services; and in the Pentecostarion,
in which are found the hymns for the services of Easter and Pentecost. A
few specimens are also given from other offices, particularly that for
Christmas.

Renderings from the work of the earlier Greek hymn-writers are added at
the end of this volume; but, unlike the hymns of the Church
service-books, these hymns originally are in the classical measures, and
illustrate the work of the best Christian poets, who in some cases wrote
extensively.

III. It is a very remarkable fact, and certainly not to our credit, that,
with the exception of a very few who have made the study a specialty, our
educated men show a most unaccountable ignorance of the most attractive
and valuable material for praise and prayer contained in the Greek Church
service-books. We have learning more than enough, and zeal enough for the
pursuit of study in other departments, but this unworked field lies
fallow, and no one thinks it worth his while to cultivate it. That the
study will reward the student, although not in a material sense--for the
meaningless prejudice of the great mass of our people for what is local
and against the thought of the stranger, no matter how beautiful it may
be, is still to be reckoned with--yet in the highest sense as conferring
upon him a new delight, there can be no doubt; for, after the necessary
expenditure of patient application, and the passing of the initiatory
stages which in every department of study are somewhat trying, the
attraction will begin, and the subject become positively fascinating. To
any one having the lyrical gift and the necessary qualifications for the
study of Greek, those service-books might prove a mine of treasure
inexhaustible. In the seventeen quarto volumes which contain the Greek
Church offices, there must be material of one kind or another for many
thousands of hymns; yet, when hymnal compilers ask for hymns from the
Greek for their collections, they are not to be had, save in the few
renderings made by Dr. Neale. In the most recently compiled collection
for church use--_The Church Hymnary_--only five pieces from the Greek
find a place. What a humbling confession! They are the best available
from the very small number of translations in our possession, which,
perhaps, does not exceed one hundred and fifty pieces in all.

We have not treated the Latin Church after that fashion. There is not a
hymn of real merit in the Latin which has not been translated, and in not
a few cases oftener than once; with the result that the gems of Latin
hymnody are the valued possession of the Church in all English-speaking
lands.

IV. One does not proceed far before making some discoveries which may
account, to a certain extent, for the neglect of Greek hymnody by men who
are best qualified to pursue the study of it. The writers are not poets,
in the true sense, and their language is not Greek as we have known it.

(1) None of the hymn-writers in the service-books or out of them is a
poet of more than ordinary merit; although, when John of Damascus forgets
his adversaries, and dispenses with his rhythmical peculiarities and
gives forth the utterance of his deep emotional nature, he proves himself
to be worthy of the title--the greatest of Greek Christian poets.

(2) The Greek language lived long and died slowly, and the Christian
hymn-writers wrote in its decadence. It was then an instrument that has
lost its fineness, and keenness, and polish--worn out and
ineffective,--not the language of the men whose thoughts still charm the
world, and who by its deft use gained for themselves and for their work
immortality. It has little of the subtilty of expression, the variety of
cadence, or the intellectual possibility, of the Greek of Homer, Plato,
and Aristophanes. It is a language, moreover, crippled by the
introduction of ecclesiastical and theological terms and phrases, which
stubbornly refuse to lend themselves to classical rhythm. Such a language
cannot be expected to have attraction for men to whom the ancient poets
are a delight.

(3) The hymns of the Greek Church are all in rhythmical prose--strangely
Oriental in appearance--with the exception of those by John of Damascus,
which are in iambics; and difficulties confront one on every page. What
lines will reward the work of rendering? Prayer, Gospel, psalm, hymn, and
exhortation follow each other, and are sometimes strangely interlaced.
Where does one begin and another end? Then, there is meaningless
repetition which must be passed over, and expressions demanding
modification. The symbolism is extravagant, and sometimes a single hymn
is crowded with figures the most grotesque. The Mariolatry is excessive,
and the hagiolatry offensive. Sifting and pruning are needed before a
cento can be formed which would commend itself to modern taste.

But when all that is said, there remains much that is both beautiful and
attractive. Some of the hymns and fragments are most chaste,--beautiful
and tender in their simple expression of Gospel truths, which are so
attractive to all true hearts, no matter by what creed dominated.

(4) The remarkable simplicity characterising those hymns constitutes,
strangely it may seem, no small difficulty for the translator. The mere
rendering of them into English prose is a comparatively easy task, and
can be of no value to any one but the specialist, but to take the
unmeasured lines and cut them to form stanzas, and in the process
sacrifice nothing of their spirit to the exigencies of rhyme and rhythm,
is a task by no means easy. But such drawbacks and difficulties are not
insurmountable; and with the growing interest in hymnology which
characterises our time, it will be strange if, in the years to come, the
Greek service-books are not made to yield their tribute to the praise of
the Christian Church in the West.

V. One prime characteristic of Greek hymnody should be referred to.
Unlike the English hymn, which is intensely subjective--in some cases
unhealthily so--the Greek hymn is in most cases objective. God in the
glory of His majesty, and clothed with His attributes, is held up to the
worship and adoration of His people. Christ, in His Person and Work, is
set before the mind in a most realistic manner. His birth and its
accompaniments; His life; the words He spoke, and the work He did; His
Passion, in all the agony of its detail; the denial of Peter; the remorse
of Judas; the Crucifixion; the darkness, the terror, the opened graves;
the penitent thief; the loud cry, the death--all are depicted in plain,
unmistakable language. So we have in the hymns of the Greek service-books
a pictorial representation of the history of Redemption, which by
engaging the mind appeals ultimately to the heart and its emotions. Our
self-regarding praise is perhaps inevitable, as being the product of the
meditative spirit which has its birth, and lives in the land of the
twilight; but the advantages of the objectiveness of Greek hymnody are so
patent, that its cultivation might be fostered by our hymn-writers, with
advantage to the devotional feeling of our people and to the worship of
the Church.

VI. The hymns as they appear in the original are distinguished by a
variety of terms, the meaning in certain cases being extremely vague, and
in others to be derived from the subject of the hymn, or from its form,
or the time, place, or manner in which it is sung. As we have no
corresponding terms in our language, it is necessary to retain the
original.

The following collection contains specimens of some of these. They are:--

_The Canon_ ({kanôn}). This is the most elaborate form into which the
praise of the Greek Church is cast. A canon consists, nominally, of nine
odes or hymns, but the second ode is always omitted on account of the
denunciations of God against Israel which it contains. The canons of the
Great Fast are made up of those rejected odes.

_Hirmos_ ({heirmos}) is the first stanza of each ode. It may or may not
have a connection with the stanzas following, but its function is to give
them their rhythmical model.

_Troparion_ ({troparion}). The Troparia are the stanzas which follow the
Hirmos, and the term is doubtless derived from the verb {trepô}, to turn.
The Troparia _turn_ to the strophes of the Hirmos, as to a model.

_Contakion_ ({kontakion}) is a term of uncertain origin. Contakia occur
after the sixth ode of a canon. They are short hymns, and the term may be
derived from the Latin _Canticum_.

_Stichera_ ({stichêra}) designates a series of verses which are often
taken from the Psalter.

_Idiomelon_ ({idiomelon}). Unlike Troparia, which follow the model set by
the Hirmos, Idiomela follow no model.

_Stichera Idiomela_ are a collection of irregular verses.

_Antiphon_ ({antiphônon}) is, as is well known, a hymn sung alternately
by the choir, which is divided for that purpose into two parts.

Other terms are found over hymns in the Greek service-books, but there is
no need to refer to them here, as no specimens of the particular hymns
find a place in this collection.

      Of all our sins before Thee.

                                   II

    For Thou Thyself art very God,

    And in our flesh the fetters broke

    Therefore we own with grateful hearts
      The joy the Saviour brought us,
    Who came to earth, and in our sins
      With love and pity sought us.

    Of Virgin born, in low estate
      Our human nature wore.

    True God! True Man! to Thee
      Our earnest prayers ascend;

      Who art the Sinners' Friend.

    Christ is born, go forth to meet Him,
      Christ by all the heaven adored;
    Singing songs of welcome, greet Him,
      For the earth receives her Lord.

    Once His heavenly image bearing,
      Man has sunk to depths of sin;
    Now defiled, debased, despairing,
      Clad in rags and foul within;
    But our God, who beauty gave,
    Lifts the soul He comes to save.

    From the height of heaven beholding,
      Pity filled the heart of grace,
    And our Lord, His love unfolding,
      Made the earth His dwelling-place;
    And a virgin mother gave
    God Incarnate, man to save.

                                   IV

    Wisdom, Might, and Word Eternal,
      Glory of the Father, Thou!
    Hid from man and powers supernal,
      Lo, He wears our nature now!
    To the Lord your worship bring,
    Praise Him, your victorious King.

    What shall we bring to Thee?
    What shall our offering be
      On this Thy natal morn?
    For Thou, O Christ, hast come to earth--
    A virgin mother gave Thee birth--
      For our redemption born.

    The whole creation broad
    Gives praise and thanks to God,
      Who gave His only Son;
    And list! the bright angelic throng
    Their homage yield in sweetest song
      For peace on earth begun.

                                   III

    The heavens their glory shed,
    The star shines o'er His head,
      The promised Christ and King;
    And wise men from the lands afar,
    Led by the brightness of the star,
      Their treasured offerings bring.

                                   IV

    What shall we give Thee now?
    Lowly the shepherds bow,
      Have we no gift to bring?
    Our worship, lo, we yield to Thee,
    All that we are, and hope to be--
      This is our offering.

    Cave and manger show the mystery;

      From the East the Magi hail;
    Taught by angel words to sing,
    We unworthy praises bring.

    Glory be to God eternal!

    Bethlehem rejoices,

      Nearer and more near.

    When Lazarus rose at Christ's command,

      The children cried Hosanna then,
    But Judas would not understand.

    When seated with Thy chosen band
      Thou didst to Thy disciples say
      That one, O Christ, would Thee betray,
    But Judas would not understand.

    But Judas would not understand.

                               {ho autos}

    Thou, with Thine own unstainèd hand,
      Didst wash the feet, and humbly teach
      That such a task becometh each,
    But Judas would not understand.

                               {ho autos}

    'Watch thou and pray,' was Thy command,
      Lest, thoughtless, the disciples fall
      Beneath the tempter's bitter thrall;

      The Master's path to-day,
    That he may into wicked hands
      The Eternal Lord betray,
    Who in the desert lone and dread
    Supplied the multitudes with bread.

    To-day the wicked one denies

      His Master in the end.
    For silver, see the Lord is sold,
    Who manna gave in days of old.

    And led them from captivity.

                                   IV

    To-day the spear is lifted high
      And thrust into His side,
    Who for His people raised His hand
      And wounded Egypt's pride;
    They give Him vinegar and gall,
    Who showered down manna on them all.

    Thou gav'st the hand its subtle power,
      But with the hand, O Lord of grace,
      Upon Thy pallid, careworn face,
    They smote Thee in that evil hour.

                                   III

    They nailed the Lord of Glory high,
      And while He hung in awful pain,
      The temple veil was rent in twain,
    The sun refused to see Him die.

    For all the good performed by Thee,
      O Christ, the Hebrews deemed it meet
      To bear Thee from the judgment-seat
    And nail Thee to the cruel tree;
      They gave Thee vinegar and gall--
      But render justice to them all.

                               {ho autos}

    'Twas not enough they should betray
      And nail Thee to the Cross to die;
      They wagged their heads and passed Thee by,
    And mocked Thee on that woful day;
      In vain they strove against Thee, Lord--
      Give Thou to them their due reward.

    The quaking earth inspires no dread,--
      The temple veil asunder fell,
      The rocks were rent--still they rebel,
    E'en when the graves gave up their dead;

      Give Thou to them their due reward.

    Thou didst accept the base and vile,
    Whose hand was stained with blood the while;
    O, number us with him, we pray!
    Thou who art good and kind alway.

    And first of men, with glad surprise,
    He entered opened Paradise.
    Be Thou for evermore adored!
    The needy's prayer was not abhorred.

    Behold the Bridegroom cometh
      At the hour of midnight drear,
    And blest be he who watcheth
      When his Master shall appear,
    But woe betide the careless one
      Asleep when He is near!

    And the Bridegroom find thee sleeping
      When He cometh in His might.
    Awake, awake to praises,
      For He cometh in the night.

      And keep it burning bright,
    Lest the voice be heard, 'He cometh!'
      In the middle of the night.

                                   IV

    Beware when slumber binds thee,
      Lest the Bridegroom pass thee by,
    And thou knock without in darkness,
      And for grief and anguish cry;
    Take thy lamp, with oil, and trim it,
      For the hour is drawing nigh.

                          CANON FOR EASTER DAY
                                   BY
                          ST. JOHN OF DAMASCUS




                          ST. JOHN OF DAMASCUS


John of Damascus is by far the most prominent and most poetical of all
the Greek Christian poets. He dwelt for many years in his native city of
Damascus, a valiant champion of orthodoxy against all comers. His
influence on Greek hymnody was immense, and he is held in high esteem by
the Greek Church for his work in that department, and as a theologian.
The _Octoechos_, which contains the Ferial Office, was, it is said,
arranged by John of Damascus. There his Canons are found, which are
perhaps his greatest work in hymnody. John retired eventually to the
monastery of Mar Saba, where he spent a life of devotion, and sang those
Christian hymns which have cheered and inspired so many generations of
Christians in the East. There he penned the 'Golden Canon' for Easter
Day, which breathes the glorious hopes of the Resurrection.

                              {ho Heirmos}

    Hail the Resurrection day!
      Let the people shout for gladness;
    'Tis a passover of joy,--
      Let us banish every sadness;
    For, from death to endless life,
      Christ our God His people bringeth;
    As from earth to heaven we rise,
      Each his song of triumph singeth.

                               {troparion}

    From our eyes the veil remove,
      That we may, in light transcending,
    See the risen Lord of Life,
      Life to all in grace extending.
    Let our ears His voice perceive;
      To His accents kind attending,
    We would hear 'All hail!' and sing,
      Every voice in triumph blending.

    Let the heavens above rejoice,
      Let the earth take up the measure;
    All the world, and all therein,
      Join the festival of pleasure;
    All things visible unite
      With invisible in singing;
    For the Christ is risen indeed,
      Everlasting gladness bringing.

    Come, let us drink the water new,
      Not from the rock divinely springing,
    But from that pure immortal stream
      That from His tomb our Lord is bringing.

                               {troparion}

    All things in earth and heaven above
      Are filled with light that shines supernal;
    So all creation keeps this feast,
      For He hath risen, the King eternal.

    With Thee, O Christ, I lay entombed,
      Ere light upon this day was falling;
    With Thee I leave death's dark abode,
      For Thou hast risen, and Thou art calling.

    With Thee upon the Cross I hung
      When Thou wast faint, and weak, and sighing;
    Lord, with Thyself Thy servant bless,
      In Thy bright realm through years undying.

    [1]Prophet of the Lord, beside us,
      Now upon the watch-tower stand;
    Let us see the light-clad angel
      Earthward come at God's command,
    Telling of His power to save,
    Who hath risen from the grave.

                               {troparion}

    He was born of Virgin Mother,
      Lamb of God on whom we feed;
    Free from every spot, and blameless,
      Yea, a Passover indeed:
    Very God His wondrous claim,
    And Perfection is His name.

    As a yearling lamb He suffered,
      He, our Blessed, saving Crown;
    That He might from vileness cleanse us,
      Freely was His life laid down;
    Now, with beauty in our eyes,
    See the glorious Sun arise.

    As the ark was borne in triumph,
      David leaped with gladness then;
    Now before the Type's fulfilment
      We should joy as holier men;
    For, omnipotent to save,
    Christ hath left the dismal grave.

    Ere the morn in beauty wake,
      Let us seek the Saviour's tomb,--
      Not with ointment and perfume,
    But with songs the silence break;
      We shall see the Christ appear,
      Sun of Righteousness to cheer.

    They who dwell in death's abode,

      In this festival of joy.

    Go ye forth amid the gloom,
      And with torches burning bright
      Cheer the darkness of the night,
    Meet the Bridegroom at the tomb;
      Greet with songs of festal glee
      Him who sets His people free.

    To depths of earth Thou didst descend,

    That held the sons of men enslaved,

    As Jonah left the living grave,
    So cam'st Thou forth, O Christ, to save.

    Unbroken were the seals when Thou
      Didst leave the dismal tomb,
    Even as the virgin bars remained
      When Thou didst leave the womb;
    And Thou hast ope'd the gates of heaven,
    And entrance free to all is given.

    O Thou, my Saviour and my God,
      Who camest from above,
    And gav'st Thyself for sinful men
      An offering of love!
    Now, rising from the grave, we see
    Our human race arise with Thee.

      For the Living God appears;
    And they tell the news abroad
    Of the risen Son of God.

    Now we celebrate the triumph,
      Death and Hades overthrown,
    Earnest of a life unending;
      All the glory is Thine own;
    God, our fathers' God, we praise,
    Blest and glorious always.

    Hallowed feast of holy gladness!
      Night that waits salvation's birth,
    Till the Resurrection morning
      Breaks with splendour on the earth,

                 THE ECTENE AND THE LITANY OF THE DEACON


These Collects hold a most important place in the services of the Eastern
Church. There are few offices in which they are not found imbedded. Their
catholicity is most remarkable. The suffrages are peculiar to no church
service, but common to all liturgies. The people share in them by
responding 'Lord have mercy' at the end of each petition, and 'Amen' at
the close.

    While we of every sin repent,
    Let our remaining years be spent
    In holiness and sweet content.
            Grant this, O Lord.

                                   VII

    And when the end of life is near,
    May we, unshamed and void of fear,
    Wait for the Judgment to appear.
            Grant this, O Lord.




                                  HYMNS
                                  FROM
                          THE EARLY GREEK POETS
           NOT FOUND IN THE SERVICE-BOOKS OF THE GREEK CHURCH




                              ST. METHODIUS


Methodius, a prominent name in Ecclesiastical history, and a Father of
the Church, was born about the middle of the third century. He was first
of all Bishop of Olympus in Lycia, and, according to Jerome, became
ultimately Bishop of Tyre. He combated certain views of Origen, but would
seem to have been influenced not a little by the teaching of that great
theologian.

In his principal work, _The Banquet of the Ten Virgins_, the hymn is
found from which the following is a cento. It contains twenty-four
strophes, each beginning with a letter of the Greek alphabet in
alphabetical order, and ending with the same refrain.

Methodius is said to have suffered martyrdom under Diocletian about 311
A.D.

                                    I

    Behold the Bridegroom! Hark the cry,
    The dead, awaking, rends the sky!
        Go, virgins, He is near,
        Your lamps all burning clear;
    He enters where the rising light
    Asunder bursts the gates of night.
        In holy garb, with lamp aglow,
        To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.

                                   II

    The smiles of earth that turn to tears,
    Its empty joys and foolish fears
        I leave, for Thou dost call--
        Thou art my Life, my All;
    I would Thy beauty ever see,
    Then let me, Blessed, cling to Thee.
        In holy garb, with lamp aglow,
        To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.

                                   III

    For Thee I leave the world behind--
    Thou art my Bliss, O Bridegroom kind;
        My beauty's not mine own--
        'Tis Thine, O Christ, alone;
    Thy bridal-chamber I would see,
    In perfect happiness to be.
        In holy garb, with lamp aglow,
        To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.

                                   IV

    O God, exalted on Thy throne,
    Who dwell'st in purity unknown,
        Lo, now we humbly wait,
        Throw wide the Heavenly gate,
    And with the Bridegroom, of Thy grace,
    Give us at Thy right hand a place.
        In holy garb, with lamp aglow,
        To meet the Bridegroom forth I go.




                               ST. GREGORY




                               ST. GREGORY


Gregory of Nazianzus, son of Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzus, and life-long
friend of Basil, Bishop of Caesarea, was born at Nazianzus, 325 A.D. He
took up the priestly office at the earnest request of his father, and for
some time was helpful to the aged bishop.

The times in which Gregory lived were trying times. The orthodox
Christians clung to the creed of Nicea, and their champions did valiant
battle with the Arians. As an advocate and exponent of evangelical truth,
Gregory was summoned to Constantinople in 379, and as bishop of that See
adorned the high position with gifts and graces as brilliant as they were
rare. But he was not the man for such a position at such a time. Hilary,
the 'Hammer of the Arians,' could keep the heretics at bay, and do in the
Latin Church what Gregory could not do in the Greek Church--maintain his
position and his cause against all comers. For one thing, the retiring
disposition of Gregory inclined him to shrink from the din of conflict,
and his high ideals weakened his hopefulness. The result was that he
abandoned his position and retired to Nazianzus in 381. Deprived by death
of his life-long friend, and of his brother Caesarius, to whom he was
bound by more than brotherly love, he retired from the world and penned
those poems, some of which are among the treasures of the Church
Catholic. He died in 390.

The hymns of Gregory are found in the second volume of the Benedictine
Edition of his works which was published in Paris in 1842. A selection
can be seen in Daniel's _Thesaurus_, and in the _Anthologica Graeca,
Carminum Christianorum_.

                                    I

    O Light that knew no dawn,
      That shines to endless day,
    All things in earth and heaven
      Are lustred by Thy ray;
    No eye can to Thy throne ascend,
    Nor mind Thy brightness comprehend.

                                   II

    Thy grace, O Father, give,
      That I may serve in fear;
    Above all boons, I pray,
      Grant me Thy voice to hear;
    From sin Thy child in mercy free,
    And let me dwell in light with Thee.

                                   III

    That, cleansed from filthy stain,
      I may meet homage give,
    And, pure in heart, behold
      And serve Thee while I live;
    Clean hands in holy worship raise,
    And Thee, O Christ my Saviour, praise.

                                   IV

    In supplication meek
      To Thee I bend the knee;
    O Christ, when Thou shalt come,
      In love remember me,
    And in Thy kingdom, by Thy grace,
    Grant me a humble servant's place.

                                    V

    Thy grace, O Father, give,
      I humbly Thee implore;
    And let Thy mercy bless
      Thy servant more and more.
    All grace and glory be to Thee
    From age to age eternally.

    Christ, for Thee a wreath adorning
      Weaves my raptured soul with glee,
    For from death this glorious morning
      Thou hast risen triumphantly.

                                   II

    From the tomb behold Him rising,
      Christ our Lord whose praise is sung.
    Death is slain; O power surprising!
      Hades' gates are open flung.

                                   III

    Thou for man to earth in meekness
      Cam'st that he new born might be;
    Thou upon the cross in weakness
      Diedst that he might die with Thee.

                                   IV

    Thou didst rise--we hail Thee, Jesus!
      And we leave the tomb with Thee.
    Victor, by the power that frees us,
      Where Thou art, there we would be.

                                    V

    Hark! the highest heavens are ringing,
      Choirs angelic lead the strain,
    And my opened lips in singing
      Tell the praises forth again.




                             AN EVENING HYMN

                         {Se kai nyn eulogoumen}


                                    I

    Now at this evening hour,
      O Thou, my Christ, to Thee,
    Thou Word of God, Eternal Light,
      All grateful praises be.

                                   II

    From Thee the Spirit comes,
      Third beam of peerless light,
    And in Thyself one glorious orb
      The triple rays unite.

                                   III

    Thy word and wisdom Thou
      To lighten man hast given,
    That he the splendour might reflect
      That shines superb in heaven;

                                   IV

    And having light within,
      Might see Thine image bright,
    And daily rise, till he himself
      Is altogether light.




                             A MORNING HYMN

                  {orthrios didômi tô theô mou dexias}


                                    I

    The morning breaks, I place my hand in Thine,
    My God, 'tis Thine to lead, to follow mine;
    No word deceitful shall I speak the while,
    Nor shall I stain my hand with action vile.

                                   II

    Thine be the day with worthy labour filled,
    Strong would I stand to do the duty willed;
    Nor swayed by restless passion let me be,
    That I may give the offering pure to Thee;

                                   III

    Else were I 'shamed when hoary age I see,
    Shamed were this board that bears Thy gifts to me:
    Mine is the impulse; O my Christ, I pray,
    Be Thou Thyself to me the Blessed Way!




                             AN EVENING HYMN

                   {epseusamên se tên alêtheian, loge}


                                    I

    O Word of Truth! in devious paths
      My wayward feet have trod,
    I have not kept the day serene
      I gave at morn to God.

                                   II

    And now 'tis night, and night within,
      O God, the light hath fled!
    I have not kept the vow I made
      When morn its glories shed.

                                   III

    For clouds of gloom from nether world
      Obscured my upward way;
    O Christ the Light, Thy light bestow
      And turn my night to day!




                                SYNESIUS




                                SYNESIUS


Synesius was born about 375. In more particulars than one he was an
outstanding man. His pedigree is said to have extended through seventeen
centuries, and to have included the names of the most illustrious. Not
only was he of noble lineage, he was a man also of high character and
brilliant attainments. He was versed in the Neoplatonic philosophy, and
his Christianity has been called in question by no less an authority than
Mosheim; but how any one can read his odes and doubt the reality of his
Christian faith, even in the full sense of the term, as believing in the
Divinity of Christ and in His Resurrection, is hard to understand. He
certainly was a good man, and knew Christ and loved Him. His writings
prove that; and in 410 A.D., though reluctantly, he became Bishop of
Ptolemais. Very little of his poetry has come down to us, but that little
is of the highest order. He died 430 A.D.

                                    I

    When darkness falls and night is here,
      My hymns of praise in silence rise--
    This knows the moon, whose silver sphere
      Shines in the star-bespangled skies.

                                   II

    When morning breaks, and glorious day
      Shines in the dawn and noontide fair--
    This knows the sun--a grateful lay
      Springs from my heart in fervent prayer.

                                   III

    When fails the light at sunset gray,
      And twilight listens for my song--
    This know the stars--in bright array
      My praises mingle with their throng.

                                    I

    O may my soul, uncrushed by care,
      Direct her gaze to where Thou art,
    And in Thy splendour find, O Christ,
      The strength of life Thou canst impart.

                                   II

    And freed from sin's depressing load,
      May I pursue the path divine,
    And rise above the cares of earth
      Until my life is merged in Thine.

                                   III

    Unsullied life Thy servant grant
      Who tunes his harp to sound Thy praise,
    And still my life shall hymn Thy love,
      And glory to the Father raise.

                                   IV

    And when I rest in glory bright,
      The burden of my labour past,
    In hymns I'll praise Thee more and more
      While the eternal ages last.




                            {age moi psycha}


                                    I

    Up, up, my soul, on wings of praise,
      No other service know;
    In holy strains the love express
      That fires the heart below.

                                   II

    Burn, burn, my soul, and ever be
      With holy ardour fired,
    And, strongly armed with firm resolve,
      Be evermore inspired.

                                   III

    Pour forth a bloodless offering
      Of hymns and holy lauds,
    And weave a garland rich and fair
      To crown the King of gods.

    In the Father's glory shining,
      Jesus, Light of light art Thou;
    Sordid night before Thee fleeth,--
      On our souls Thou'rt falling now.

                                   II

    Framer of the world, we hail Thee!
      Thou didst mould the stars of night;
    Earth to life Thou dost awaken,
      Saviour Thou, of glorious might!

                                   III

    'Tis Thy hand that guides the chariot
      When the sun illumes the skies,
    And the dark of night relaxes
      When Thou bidst the moon arise.

                                   IV

    At Thy word the harvest ripens,
      Flocks and herds their pasture find;
    Earth gives bread to feed the hungry,
      For the hand of God is kind.

                                    V

    May my soul, her want perceiving,
      Turn her gaze to where Thou art,
    And in all Thy fulness find Thee
      Food to satisfy the heart.

  When Lazarus rose at Christ's command,                               40
  When, O King Immortal,                                               52
  When on the cruel Cross,                                             39
  When Thou shalt come, O Lord,                                        62
  When Thou wert crucified by men,                                     46
